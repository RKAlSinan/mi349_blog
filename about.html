        <h2>My Experience in Media and Info Major</h2>
            <p>I'm so glad that I found this major, I enjoyed every MI class I took so far, and can't wait for more. I feel a little sad that I did not knew about it earlier, because if so I would have taking more classes and had the time to expand my knowledge in this field more, but now I have to graduate in 2021. Anyway my focus area is management, and I'm taking web design classes from the game design area.</p>

        <h2>Who is Reem AlSinan?</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Reem AlSinan, I am from Eastern Saudi Arabia, I was born in the city of Dhahran, but I'm originally from Qatif and I studied and lived in Qatif. After I graduated from high school I decided to study abroad, and I choose Michigan State University because my two brothers studied at MSU, two of my cousins, as well as my father graduated from MSU. I came for Chemical Engineering major, I took English Second Language classes at the MSU English Language Center, and When I started my Academic classes I started with Chemical Engineering major, however I did not like it so I changed it to Civil Engineering, and guess what? I was still struggling, finally after a long time of thinking and searching for what I like and what could I be good at, I decided to switch to Media and Information, which actually was suggested by my friend who was actually an MI major too. I did not change my major right away, but I decided to give it a shot I take introductory class for MI to see if this was something I might enjoy. Luckily, I took MI 101 (Introduction for Media and Information) and I enjoyed this class to the max, and after that semester ended, I changed my major to MI right away. </p>
